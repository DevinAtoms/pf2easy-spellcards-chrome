# pf2easy-spellcards-chrome

Just a basic Google Chrome extension that injects some JS and CSS into the PF2Easy Spellbook Printouts, turning them into printable spell cards.

Credit for all of the real functionality goes to [arthurvanpassel](https://github.com/arthurvanpassel) and [pf2easy-spell-cards](https://github.com/arthurvanpassel/pf2easy-spell-cards/tree/main), I just wrapped it into an extension for ease of use.
