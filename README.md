# pf2easy-spellcards-chrome

Just a basic Google Chrome extension that injects some JS and CSS into the PF2Easy Spellbook Printouts, turning them into printable spell cards.

Credit for all of the real functionality goes to [arthurvanpassel](https://github.com/arthurvanpassel) and [pf2easy-spell-cards](https://github.com/arthurvanpassel/pf2easy-spell-cards/tree/main), I just wrapped it into an extension for ease of use.

Extension isn't currently on the Chrome Web Store, so it will need to be loaded as an unpacked extension. Just clone the repo, install dependencies, npm run build, and load the extension from the 'dist' directory.
